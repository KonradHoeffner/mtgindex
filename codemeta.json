    "description": "This Magic: The Gathering card image Scryfall link index is an opinionated selection of attributes and between different prints based on my asthetic preferences, generally preferring old borders and original printings.\nGenerated by transforming the Scryfall bulk data to smaller files where each file occurs only once that you can directly include in your JavaScript code.\nSuitable for applications that do not discern between different printings of a card, such as commander decklists.",
